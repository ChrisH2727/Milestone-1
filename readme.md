- The design will use a limited pallet of colours (less than 5?)

- Each page will be structured using the "rule of three"

- Coding will make extensive use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)


## 4. Site Test Requirements

### 4.1 Test Approach

1. Use available on line tools to confirm that the code (HTML & CSS) complies with industry standards

2. Use available browser tool emulators to confirming that web pages render correctly on devices using differnt screen sizes

3. View completed web pages on physical devices to confirm the results of the emulations.

4. Exercise all references and links to ensure that they land at the nominated.

### 4.2 Test Tools

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C CSS Validation Service](http://www.css-validator.org/)
- Google Browser Developer Tools
- Physical devices featuring different screen sizes 

### 4.3 Test Cases

|Test Case No.|Description|Method|Expected Outcome|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|HTML code is compliant|Run all pages through the W3C validator|No errors identified
|2|CSS code is compliant|Run CSS file through W3C validator|No errors identified
|3|Confirm that all pages render corerctly at screen sizes of 576px for phones, 786px for tablets, 992px for desk tops and 1200px for large screens  | Verify correct rendering using Google Browser Development Tools |For small screen the Nav bar is rendered as a "burger icon" |
